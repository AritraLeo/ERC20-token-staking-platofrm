# ERC20-token-staking-platofrm
This is a very interesting project where the custom erc20 tokens I've made can be staked for a period and in return user can receive other tokens when the period is over. For other tokens the rate can varied. All in all it's a pretty good app to grasp the concept of staking in web 3.
